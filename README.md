## Outline of Engagement

- **Phase 1:** Consult
Meeting with the team and Dojo coaches to discuss team availability, maturity, capabilities, tech stack, composition, and Dojo outcomes
- **Phase 2:** Charter
Deep dive with Dojo participants, stakeholders, and Dojo coaches to uncover the team's challenges and identify their key results and outcomes of the Dojo
- **Phase 3:** Dojo
Immersive environment for team to learn and collaborate, improve or evolve individual and team mindsets, and reinforce the knowledge and practices needed to instill new ways of working
- **Phase 4:** Aftercare
Opportunity for Dojo graduates to have clearly defined next steps for continued success and on-going support after they complete the Dojo


## Phase 1: Consult
The purpose of the consult is to interview Dojo participants and key stakeholders to explain the purpose of the Dojo and the approach the Dojo will follow. The Consult also allows the Dojo coaches to understand the product, technology, and organization so they can more effectively help the team.


## Phase 2: Charter
The Charter phase is a chance for the team to articulate their current challenges and identify their goals and outcomes of the Dojo.

The objectives of the Charter are:
- Introduce the Dojo and align on expectations
- Align on the product vision (elevator pitch)
- Understand the application architecture & flow including internal and external partners
- Technical assessment and gaps
- Map out team's path to production using Lean Process Map and identify opportunities
- Identify current challenges with team including the product, process and technology
- Identify a goal and success criteria (Objectives and Key Results) for the Dojo
- Establish how the team will work together throughout the Dojo experience


## Phase 3: Dojo
The Dojo itself will consist of a six week intensive collaboration focusing on behaviors, culture, development process, and tooling. Team members will pair and swarm with coaches to work on specific tasks. The team and coaches will "rise or fall together" as they work through very short iterations working on real work assigned to the team. Throughout the process the team and coaches will continually assess progress towards the goal and OKRs and adjust behaviors and processes to better achieve the objectives of the Dojo. 

**Anticipated Results of the Dojo:**
- Measurable improvements to key team metrics like lead time, velocity, throughput, deployment frequency, system resiliency and uptime, quality, etc.
- Increased flow of value from the team, this can be measured using flow metrics like flow time (time to market) and flow load (demand vs capacity).
- Improvement in morale and psychological safety on the team. This can be informally assessed through one-on-ones with engineering leadership or with employee satisfaction (ESAT) or Net Promoter (NPS) surveys. This can translate to improved retention and recruiting. 


## Phase 4: Aftercare
At the end of the Dojo, the coaches and team will produce a State-of-the-Dojo report outlining the results of the Dojo in terms of and recommended next steps The State-of-the-Dojo report includes the following: 
- Review of OKRs
- Next steps and action items
- Recommendations for practices, tools, and process improvements
- Potential for future Dojos for the team


## Scaling
After the Dojo, the goal is to scale the Dojo practice across the engineering organization. The coaches will provide recommendations for scaling the practice which may include:
- Choose teams with strong practices and high visibility and respect within the organization. These teams can be effective evangelists.  
- Identify coaches and champions from the initial cohort to be ongoing coaches for the subsequent teams and involve those in-house coaches in future Dojos.
- Create post-Dojo Centers of Excellence based on key practices, tools, and processes that were proven to be successful in the Dojo 
- Encourage teams to cycle through the Dojo multiple times to further improve their practice. 
- Iterate on the Dojo itself and continuously improve the process and offering.
